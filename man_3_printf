_printf Manual Page

/ DESCRIPTION

The _printf function writes output to stdout according to a format as described below.
It writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier.

/ Conversion specifiers

 The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:

c	The argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
s	Print a string. The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). The array must contain a terminating null byte.
i	Print an integer.
d	The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation and printed.
%	Print the char '%'.
